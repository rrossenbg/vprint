Configuration :: Report Viewer Doesn't Work On '08 64 Bit Server? 
I have a website that is using the ASP.Net report viewer web control which links to our Reporting Server.

We've also built a new WebServer using Server 2008 64bit. I've had some trouble getting this to work in general,
 but have figured it all out except for this last problem.

When I publish this website to our old WebServer that uses Server 2003 32bit, I have zero problems, the reports pull up
 as expected. But when I publish to the new webserver, the site works perfectly up until I try to load the Report Viewer page. 
 I don't get any runtime errors, the only thing I get is the picture below. When I open up the IE errors, 
 it basically says that it can't find any of the pictures, and everything is set to a null instance of the object.

I've installed BIDS 2008, the report viewer control and sp1 for it, and have asp.net 3.5, and all of the asp.net 
development features enabled.

            ReportingService2005 server = new ReportingService2005();
            server.Credentials = System.Net.CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials;
